Description: Estimate necessary sample sizes for comparing the location
    of data from two groups or categories when the distribution of the 
    data is skewed. The package 
    offers a non-parametric method for a Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test of 
    location shift as well as methods for several generalized linear 
    models, for instance, Gamma regression.
